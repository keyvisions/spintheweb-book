## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security
vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to security@spintheweb.org with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., code injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Location** (specific files, line numbers, or sections in the book)
- **Potential impact** on systems implementing the described solutions
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Proof of concept** (if applicable and safe to share)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week with preliminary assessment
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity, but we aim for timely fixes

## Security Considerations for Book Content

### Code Examples

- All code examples are provided for educational purposes
- Review and adapt security measures before production use
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Follow secure coding practices for your specific environment

### Portal Development Security

When implementing the concepts from this book:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement robust user authentication
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Validate all user inputs

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring

4. **Portal-Specific Considerations**
   - Validate all portal configurations
   - Sanitize user-generated content
   - Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Readers/Implementers

- Always review code examples before implementation
- Conduct security testing on any deployed solutions
- Keep frameworks and dependencies updated
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

### For Contributors

- Run security linters on all code contributions
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Document any security implications of changes

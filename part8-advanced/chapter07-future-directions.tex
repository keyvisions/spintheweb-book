Looking ahead, a significant evolution for the \textbf{Spin the Web Studio} is the integration of AI agents. In this vision, the Studio would transform from a manual editing tool into an intelligent development environment. An AI agent could assist the full-stack professional by providing automated assistance and intelligent recommendations throughout the development process.

\section{AI-Driven WBDL Generation}

\section{Looking Forward}
\label{sec:ai-future}

The integration of AI agents into the Spin the Web Studio represents a major leap forward, allowing developers to build and maintain portals with greater speed and precision. This would make the Studio an even more effective component of the Spin the Web ecosystem, enabling organizations to create sophisticated, enterprise-grade portals more efficiently than ever before.

The vision of AI-assisted portal development aligns with the broader goal of the Spin the Web Project: to simplify the complexity of enterprise software integration while maintaining the power and flexibility needed for sophisticated business requirements. By combining human expertise with AI intelligence, the future Studio will empower developers to focus on high-level design and business logic while automating the repetitive and error-prone aspects of portal development.

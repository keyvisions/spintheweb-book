# The Spin the Web Project

## Abstract

This document details the **Spin the Web Project**, a framework for building web
portals. It is built upon three core components: the **Webbase Description
Language (WBDL)**, a declarative language for modeling a portal's structure,
content, and behavior; the **Web Spinner**, a server-side engine that interprets
WBDL to dynamically generate the user experience; and the **Spin the Web
Studio**, a specialized **webbaselet** for editing webbases. The project's
central thesis is the concept of a portal as a "virtualized company," providing
a unified interface for diverse user groups such as customers, employees, and
suppliers. Webbaselets are modular, self-contained WBDL fragments that allow for
the seamless integration of disparate enterprise systems (like ERPs and CRMs)
into a single, coherent webbase.

## Introduction

In today's digital economy, businesses operate through a complex web of
disparate software systems—ERPs, CRMs, BPMSs, MRPs, and much more. While
capable, these systems often create siloed user experiences, forcing employees,
customers, and partners to navigate multiple interfaces to perform their tasks.
This fragmentation leads to inefficiency, poor user adoption, and a disjointed
view of the enterprise.

The **Spin the Web Project** addresses this challenge head-on. The word "Spin"
is used in the sense of "to weave," as a spider dynamically weaves a web. The
project is designed to weave together disparate systems and user experiences
into a single, coherent whole, based on Internet technologies. It introduces a
new paradigm for developing web portals centered on three core components: a
specialized language, the **Webbase Description Language (WBDL)**; a server-side
rendering engine, the **Web Spinner**; and a specialized webbaselet for editing
webbases, the **Spin the Web Studio**. The project's core mission is to enable
the creation of unified, role-based web portals that act as a "virtualized
company"—a single, coherent digital channel for all business interactions.

This document serves as the foundational guide for the Spin the Web project. It
outlines the vision, defines the core components of the WBDL specification, and
provides concrete examples of how this technology can be used to build the next
generation of integrated web portals.

It is important to note that the Spin the Web Project is a professional
framework intended for full-stack developers. It is not a low-code/no-code
platform for the general public, but rather a comprehensive toolset for
engineers building bespoke, enterprise-grade web portals.

## Web Portals

Web portals are **"websites on steroids."** They expand on the concept of a
traditional website by serving a diverse, segmented audience that includes not
only the general public but also internal and external stakeholders like
employees, clients, suppliers, governance bodies, developers....

Web portals function as **virtualized companies**, an all-encompassing digital
channel that allows individuals, based on their specific role, to interact with
every facet of the organization—from administration and logistics to sales,
marketing, human resources, and production. It is a comprehensive platform for:

- **Multi-Audience Communication**: Providing tailored content and functionality
  for different user groups.
- **Bi-directional Data Interaction**: Enabling users to not only consume data
  but also to input, manage, and interact with it, effectively participating in
  business processes.
- **Centralized Access**: Acting as a single point of access to a wide array of
  company information, applications, and services.
- **Role-Based Personalization**: Ensuring that the experience is secure and
  customized, granting each user access only to the information and tools
  relevant to their role.
- **System-to-System Integration**: Exposing its functionalities as an API,
  allowing it to be contacted by other web portals or external systems, which
  can interact with it programmatically.

WBDL is the language specifically designed to model the complexity of web
portals, defining their structures, data integrations, and authorization rules
that govern this dynamic digital ecosystem.

### Integration Vision

The concept of the **webbaselet** opens the door to a vision for the future of
enterprise software. In this vision, monolithic and disparate systems like
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM),
Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), and Manufacturing Resource Planning
(MRP) no longer need to exist in separate silos with their own disjointed user
interfaces.

Instead, the front-end of each of these critical business systems could be
engineered as a self-contained **webbaselet**. These webbaselets could then be
seamlessly integrated into a single, unified company **webbase**.

The result would be a high level of coherence and consistency across the entire
enterprise software landscape. Users would navigate a single, familiar portal
environment, moving effortlessly between what were once separate applications.
This approach would not only improve the user experience but also simplify the
development, deployment, and maintenance of enterprise front-ends.

Extending large platforms can be costly. Spin the Web excels at adding smaller,
targeted features that are often prohibitively expensive for major vendors to
implement.

## The WBDL Language

WBDL is formally defined using two standard schema languages: **XML Schema
Definition (XSD)** and **JSON Schema**. This dual-schema approach ensures broad
compatibility and facilitates validation and data exchange across different
platforms and programming languages.

### The Book Analogy

To better understand the structure of a web portal defined in WBDL, it's helpful
to use the analogy of a book. The portal is organized hierarchically, much like
a book is divided into chapters, pages, and paragraphs.

- **Areas (`STWArea`)**: These are the main sections of the portal, analogous to
  the **chapters** of a book. An area groups related pages together.
- **Pages (`STWPage`)**: Contained within Areas, these are the individual
  **pages** of the book. Each page holds the actual content that users will see.
- **Content (`STWContents`)**: These are the building blocks of a page, similar
  to the **paragraphs** or other content elements (like images or tables) on a
  page.

`STWArea`, `STWPage`, and `STWContent` are all specialized types that inherit
from the base `STWElement`, sharing its common properties while also having
their own specific attributes and behaviors.

### Portal Organization and User Journeys

The structure of a web portal built with WBDL is typically organized around the
core functions of the business it represents. This creates a logical and
intuitive navigation system for all users. Common top-level **Areas
(`STWArea`)** would include:

- Sales
- Administration
- Backoffice
- Technical Office
- Logistics
- Products & Services (often publicly viewable)

The full potential of the portal is revealed when we consider the specific
journeys of different users, or **personas**. The portal uses a role-based
system to present a completely different experience to each user, tailored to
their needs and permissions.

### Example User Journeys:

- **The Customer:**
  - Logs into the portal and is directed to a personalized "Customer Dashboard"
    page.
  - Can view their complete order history in a dedicated "My Orders" area.
  - Can track the real-time status of current orders (e.g., "Processing,"
    "Shipped").
  - Can initiate a video chat with their designated sales representative
    directly from the portal.
  - Can open a support ticket or schedule a consultation with the Technical
    Office.

- **The Supplier:**
  - Logs in and sees a "Supplier Dashboard."
  - Can access a "Kanban View" page to see which materials or components require
    replenishment.
  - Can submit new quotations through an integrated form.
  - Can view the status of their invoices and payments.

- **The Employee:**
  - Logs in and is presented with an "Employee Self-Service" area.
  - Can access a "Welfare Management" page to view and adjust their benefits.
  - Can view internal company news, submit vacation requests, and access HR
    documents.

- **The CEO:**
  - Logs in to a high-level "Executive Dashboard."
  - Can view key performance indicators (KPIs) for the entire company, such as
    sales figures, production output, and financial health.
  - Can access detailed reports from various departments.

These user journeys demonstrate how WBDL's hierarchical structure and role-based
visibility rules work together to create a highly functional and personalized
web portal that serves as a central hub for the entire business ecosystem.

## The Web Spinner

WBDL is processed by a server-side engine called the **Web Spinner**. In a
direct analogy to how a client-side web browser renders HTML into a user-facing
webpage, the Web Spinner interprets WBDL descriptions to generate and manage the
web portal on the server. It is the runtime engine of the project, complemented
by the **Spin the Web Studio**, which serves as the design-time tool for
creating and modifying the webbase itself. This architecture allows for dynamic,
data-driven portal generation based on the WBDL specification.

When the Web Spinner starts, it loads the webbase (whether in XML or JSON
format) into memory. This webbase is transformed into an optimized, in-memory
object, allowing for fast access and manipulation of the portal's structure.

The Web Spinner's primary roles are routing and content delivery:

1. **URL-Based Routing:** It maps the incoming URL directly to a webbase object.
   For example, a URL like `https://portal.acme.com/areaslug/areaslug/pageslug`
   is interpreted as a path to a specific `STWPage` element within the webbase
   hierarchy.

2. **Page Composition:** When a user requests a page, the Web Spinner acts as
   the initial router. It identifies the requested page and its associated
   `STWContent` elements. Crucially, it checks the `visibility` rules for the
   page and each content element against the user's roles. Elements that are not
   visible to the user are filtered out and never sent to the client. The
   spinner then returns the list of slugs for the visible contents.

3. **Asynchronous Content Fetching:** The client receives the list of content
   slugs and proceeds to request each one asynchronously and individually. For
   instance, it would request
   `https://portal.acme.com/areaslug/areaslug/pageslug/contentslug`. This
   approach allows the main page structure to load quickly while content is
   fetched in parallel, improving perceived performance.

4. **Dynamic Content:** A content element is not limited to rendering data but
   also managing data like an API.

This architecture ensures that the server handles the core logic of structure,
routing, and security, while the client is responsible for the final rendering,
leading to a flexible and performant web portal.

## Web Spinner Architecture and Mechanics

The Web Spinner operates as a server-side engine that orchestrates the entire
portal experience. This section delves into the detailed mechanics of how the
Web Spinner manages the complete lifecycle of user interactions, from startup to
content delivery.

### System Startup and Initialization

When the Web Spinner starts up, it performs several critical initialization
steps:

1. **Webbase Loading**: The engine loads the complete WBDL document (webbase)
   from disk, whether stored in XML or JSON format. This document contains the
   entire portal structure, including all areas, pages, content definitions, and
   configuration data.

2. **In-Memory Optimization**: The loaded webbase is parsed and transformed into
   an optimized in-memory object graph. This transformation includes:
   - Resolving all GUID references between elements
   - Building navigation hierarchies for fast traversal
   - Pre-compiling visibility rules for rapid role-based filtering
   - Indexing elements by slug for efficient URL routing

3. **Datasource Configuration**: All datasources defined in the `STWSite`
   element are initialized and connection pools are established. This includes
   databases, REST APIs, file systems, and any other external data providers.

4. **Route Table Generation**: A comprehensive routing table is built from the
   webbase structure, mapping URL patterns to specific `STWPage` and
   `STWContent` elements.

### User Session Management

The Web Spinner maintains stateful user sessions to manage authentication,
authorization, and personalization:

1. **Session Establishment**: When a user first accesses the portal, a new
   session is created with a unique identifier, guest is set as the session user
   (guest has is assigned the guests role). Sessions are maintained using
   cookies, JWT tokens, or other mechanisms.

2. **Authentication Integration**: The system integrates with various
   authentication providers (LDAP, OAuth, SAML, etc.) to verify user credentials
   and establish their identity.

3. **Role Assignment**: Once authenticated, the user's roles are determined
   through integration with identity providers or internal role mappings. These
   roles are cached in the session for performance.

4. **Session State**: The session maintains:
   - User identity and roles
   - Current language preference
   - Navigation history
   - Cached query results (when appropriate)
   - Active datasource connections

### Request Routing and Processing

The Web Spinner handles incoming HTTP requests through a routing mechanism:

1. **URL Parsing**: Incoming URLs are parsed to extract the area/page/content
   hierarchy. For example:
   - `https://portal.acme.com/sales/dashboard` → Area: "sales", Page:
     "dashboard"
   - `https://portal.acme.com/sales/dashboard/orders-table` → Area: "sales",
     Page: "dashboard", Content: "orders-table"

2. **Element Resolution**: Using the pre-built routing table, URLs are resolved
   to specific WBDL elements. Missing or invalid paths result in no result in
   case of contents the nearest site or area main page in case of a page.

3. **Protocol Handling**: The Web Spinner supports both HTTP and WebSocket
   protocols:
   - **HTTP**: Used for standard page and content requests, following RESTful
     principles
   - **WebSocket**: Used for real-time content updates, live data feeds, and
     interactive features

### Visibility and Authorization Engine

Before any content is delivered, the Web Spinner performs comprehensive
authorization checks:

1. **Role-Based Filtering**: For each requested element (page or content), the
   visibility rules are evaluated against the user's session roles:
   - Elements with no matching role rules inherit visibility from their parent
     elements
   - The hierarchical check continues up to the root element
   - Elements without explicit or inherited visibility permissions are denied by
     default

2. **Dynamic Filtering**: Visibility checks are performed in real-time for every
   request, ensuring that changes to user roles or permissions take immediate
   effect.

3. **Secure Response Generation**: Only authorized elements are included in the
   response. Unauthorized elements are completely omitted, preventing
   information leakage.

### Content Request and Response Cycle

The Web Spinner handles content requests through a multi-stage process:

1. **Page Structure Delivery**: When a page is requested, the Web Spinner:
   - Identifies all visible `STWContent` elements for the page
   - Returns a lightweight response containing the list of content slugs and
     their metadata
   - Includes section assignments and sequencing information for layout

2. **Asynchronous Content Fetching**: The client then requests individual
   content elements:
   - Each content request triggers a separate web socket call to the Web Spinner
   - Content elements are fetched in parallel, improving perceived performance
   - Each content element is processed independently, allowing for granular
     caching and error handling

3. **Content Processing Pipeline**: For each content request, the Web Spinner:
   - Validates user authorization for the specific content element
   - Resolves the associated datasource and query
   - Processes the query through the WBPL (Webbase Placeholders Language) engine
   - Executes the processed query against the datasource
   - Applies the content layout transformation
   - Returns the rendered content or raw data (depending on the request type)

### Datasource Connection and Query Management

The Web Spinner maintains a sophisticated datasource management system:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Database and API connections are pooled and reused
   across requests to optimize performance and resource utilization.

2. **Query Processing**: Raw queries defined in `STWContent` elements undergo
   several processing steps:
   - **WBPL Processing**: Placeholders are resolved using session data, URL
     parameters, and global variables
   - **Security Validation**: Processed queries are validated to prevent
     injection attacks
   - **Optimization**: Query plans may be cached for frequently-executed queries

3. **Multi-Datasource Support**: The system supports heterogeneous datasources:
   - **Relational Databases**: SQL queries with full WBPL placeholder support
   - **REST APIs**: HTTP requests with parameter substitution and response
     transformation
   - **NoSQL Databases**: Native query languages (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, etc.)
   - **File Systems**: Direct file access and processing

4. **Error Handling**: Datasource errors are gracefully handled:
   - Connection failures trigger automatic retry logic
   - Query errors are logged and appropriate error responses are returned
   - Partial failures in multi-content pages don't affect other content elements

### Just-in-Time Content Layout Compilation

The Web Spinner employs a dynamic compilation approach for content layouts:

1. **Layout Processing**: The `STWLayout` elements containing Webbase Layout
   Language are compiled on-demand:
   - Layout templates are parsed and validated
   - Data binding expressions are resolved
   - Component hierarchies are built

2. **Caching Strategy**: Compiled layouts are cached in memory with invalidation
   based on:
   - Layout template changes
   - Datasource schema changes
   - User role changes that might affect layout visibility

3. **Responsive Rendering**: Layout compilation takes into account:
   - Device type and screen size (from HTTP headers)
   - User preferences and accessibility requirements
   - Performance constraints and bandwidth limitations

### Performance Optimization and Timeout Management

The Web Spinner implements several performance and reliability features:

1. **Content Timeouts**: Each content element has configurable timeout settings:
   - **Query Timeout**: Maximum time allowed for datasource queries
   - **Layout Timeout**: Maximum time for layout compilation and rendering
   - **Total Request Timeout**: Overall timeout for content delivery

2. **Caching Mechanisms**: Multiple levels of caching improve performance:
   - **Query Result Caching**: Datasource results are cached based on query
     signatures
   - **Layout Caching**: Compiled layouts are cached until templates change
   - **Response Caching**: Complete HTTP responses may be cached for static
     content

3. **Load Balancing**: Multiple Web Spinner instances can operate in parallel:
   - Session affinity ensures consistent user experience
   - Shared cache layers enable scaling across multiple servers
   - Health monitoring ensures failed instances are automatically excluded

4. **Monitoring and Metrics**: The Web Spinner provides comprehensive
   monitoring:
   - Request/response times and throughput metrics
   - Datasource performance and error rates
   - User session analytics and behavior patterns
   - System resource utilization and capacity planning data

This architecture ensures that the Web Spinner can handle enterprise-scale
workloads while maintaining high performance, security, and reliability
standards.

## Spin the Web Studio

The third and final component of the Spin the Web Project is the **Spin the Web
Studio**. Alongside the **WBDL** and the **Web Spinner**, it completes the
framework. The Spin the Web Studio is a specialized webbaselet engineered for
editing webbases. To use it, you simply add the webbaselet to the webbase you
wish to edit, enabling direct, in-place modification.

## The STWElement Base

WBDL defines a base element, `STWElement`, from which all other elements
inherit. Below is the XSD definition for this fundamental type.

```xml
<xs:complexType name="STWElement">
    <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="name" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="1" />
        <xs:element name="slug" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="1" />
        <xs:element name="keywords" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="0" />
        <xs:element name="description" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="0" />
        <xs:element name="visibility" type="STWVisibility" minOccurs="0" />

                <xs:choice minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded">
                    <xs:element name="area" type="STWArea" />
                    <xs:element name="page" type="STWPage" />
                    <xs:element name="content" type="STWContent" />
                </xs:choice>
            </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>
    </xs:sequence>
    <xs:attribute name="_id" type="GUID" use="required" />
    <xs:attribute name="type" type="STWElementType" use="required" />
</xs:complexType>

<xs:simpleType name="GUID">
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
        <xs:pattern value="[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}" />
    </xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>

<xs:simpleType name="STWElementType">
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
        <xs:enumeration value="Site"/>
        <xs:enumeration value="Area"/>
        <xs:enumeration value="Page"/>
        <xs:enumeration value="Content"/>
    </xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>

<xs:complexType name="STWLocalized">
    <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="text" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded">
            <xs:complexType>
                <xs:simpleContent>
                    <xs:extension base="xs:string">
                        <xs:attribute name="lang" type="xs:language" use="required"/>
                    </xs:extension>
                </xs:simpleContent>
            </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>
    </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

<xs:complexType name="STWVisibility">
    <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="rule" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
            <xs:complexType>
                <xs:attribute name="role" type="xs:string" use="required"/>
                <xs:attribute name="visible" type="xs:boolean" use="required"/>
            </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>
    </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

<xs:complexType name="STWLayout">
    <xs:complexContent>
        <xs:extension base="STWLocalized">
            <!-- Content holds Webbase Layout Language text, to be defined later. -->
        </xs:extension>
    </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
```

### Property Description:

- **_id**: A unique identifier for the element (GUID).
- **type**: The specific type of the element. Can be one of 'Site', 'Area',
  'Page', or 'Content'.
- **name**: A localizable name for the element. It is composed of one or more
  `text` elements, each with a `lang` attribute specifying the language (e.g.,
  "en", "it-IT"). The text content is wrapped in `<![CDATA[...]]>` to prevent
  issues with special characters. Example:
  `<name><text lang="en"><![CDATA[R&D]]></text><text lang="it"><![CDATA[R&S]]></text></name>`
- **slug**: A localizable, URL-friendly version of the name. It is initially
  derived from the `name` by converting it to lowercase and removing all
  characters except for letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_),
  but can be manually overridden. Follows the same structure as `name`.
- **keywords**: Localizable keywords for SEO. Follows the same structure as
  `name`.
- **description**: A localizable description of the element. Follows the same
  structure as `name`.
- **visibility**: Defines the visibility rules for the element based on user
  roles. It contains a set of rules, where each rule assigns `true` (visible) or
  `false` (not visible) to a specific role. If a rule for a role is not defined
  (is `null`), the visibility is determined by checking the parent element's
  visibility rules. This hierarchical check continues up to the root element. If
  no rule is found, the element is not visible by default.
- **children**: A list of child `STWElement` objects.

## WBDL Element Types

This section describes the specialized element types available in WBDL.

### STWSite

`STWSite` is a singleton element that represents the entire web portal. It
inherits from `STWElement` and acts as the root element of the portal structure.
There must be exactly one `STWSite` element in any WBDL document.

```xml
<xs:complexType name="STWSite">
    <xs:complexContent>
        <xs:extension base="STWElement">
            <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element name="langs" minOccurs="0">
                    <xs:complexType>
                        <xs:sequence>
                            <xs:element name="lang" type="xs:language" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                        </xs:sequence>
                    </xs:complexType>
                </xs:element>
                <xs:element name="datasources" minOccurs="0">
                    <xs:complexType>
                        <xs:sequence>
                            <xs:any processContents="lax" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                        </xs:sequence>
                    </xs:complexType>
                </xs:element>
            </xs:sequence>
            <xs:attribute name="mainpage" type="GUID"/>
            <xs:attribute name="version" type="xs:string"/>
        </xs:extension>
    </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
```

#### Property Description:

- **langs**: A list of supported languages for the site. The first of the list
  is the default site language.
- **datasources**: Defines the data sources used by the portal.
- **mainpage**: The GUID of the `STWPage` that serves as the main entry point
  for the site.
- **version**: A version string for the site.

### STWArea

`STWArea` represents a logical grouping of pages, analogous to a chapter in a
book. It extends the base `STWElement`.

```xml
<xs:complexType name="STWArea">
    <xs:complexContent>
        <xs:extension base="STWElement">
            <xs:attribute name="mainpage" type="GUID"/>
            <xs:attribute name="version" type="xs:string"/>
        </xs:extension>
    </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
```

#### Property Description:

- **mainpage**: The GUID of the `STWPage` that serves as the main entry point
  for this area.
- **version**: A version string for the area.

### STWPage

`STWPage` represents a single page in the portal. It extends the base
`STWElement` but restricts its `children` to only `STWContent` elements.

```xml
<xs:complexType name="STWPage">
    <xs:complexContent>
        <xs:restriction base="STWElement">
            <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element name="name" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="1" />
                <xs:element name="slug" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="1" />
                <xs:element name="keywords" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="0" />
                <xs:element name="description" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="0" />
                <xs:element name="visibility" type="STWVisibility" minOccurs="0" />
                <xs:element name="children" minOccurs="0">
                    <xs:complexType>
                        <xs:sequence>
                            <xs:element name="content" type="STWContent" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                        </xs:sequence>
                    </xs:complexType>
                </xs:element>
            </xs:sequence>
            <xs:attribute name="_id" type="GUID" use="required" />
            <xs:attribute name="type" type="STWElementType" use="required" />
        </xs:restriction>

### STWContent

`STWContent` represents a piece of content on a page. It extends the base
`STWElement` but is not allowed to have any `children`. It adds several
attributes for data binding and layout control.

```xml
<xs:complexType name="STWContent">
    <xs:complexContent>
        <xs:restriction base="STWElement">
            <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element name="name" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="1" />
                <xs:element name="slug" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="1" />
                <xs:element name="keywords" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="0" />
                <xs:element name="description" type="STWLocalized" minOccurs="0" />
                <xs:element name="visibility" type="STWVisibility" minOccurs="0" />
                <xs:element name="layout" type="STWLayout" />
            </xs:sequence>
            <xs:attribute name="_id" type="GUID" use="required" />
            <xs:attribute name="type" type="STWElementType" use="required" fixed="Content" />
            <xs:attribute name="subtype" type="xs:string" />
            <xs:attribute name="cssClass" type="xs:string" />
            <xs:attribute name="section" type="xs:string" />
            <xs:attribute name="sequence" type="xs:integer" />
            <xs:attribute name="dsn" type="xs:string" />
            <xs:attribute name="query" type="xs:string" />
            <xs:attribute name="params" type="xs:string" />
        </xs:restriction>
    </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
```

#### Property Description:

- **type**: Overrides the base element's type and is fixed to "Content".
- **subtype**: Specifies the type of content to be rendered, which determines
  the component used on the front-end. Possible values include `Text`, `Form`,
  `Table`, `Tree`, `Calendar`, and `Breadcrumbs`.
- **cssClass**: An optional CSS class to apply to the content element for
  styling.
- **section**: The name of the page section where this content should be
  rendered (e.g., "header", "main", "sidebar").
- **sequence**: A number that determines the order of content within a section.
- **dsn**: The "data source name," which identifies a specific data source
  configured in the `STWSite` element.
- **query**: The query to be executed against the specified data source. Before
  execution, the query text is processed by the **Webbase Placeholders Language
  (WBPL)** processor. This processor replaces placeholders within the query with
  values sourced from several locations: the `params` attribute, the URL
  querystring, session variables, global variables, and HTTP headers. After this
  substitution, the resulting query is executed by the data source using its
  native language (e.g., SQL for a relational database, or JSONata if the data
  source is a JSON-based API).
- **params**: A string containing parameters for the query, formatted as a
  standard query string (e.g., `key1=value1&key2=value2`).
- **layout**: The `STWLayout` element that defines how the fetched data should
  be rendered.

### STWContentWithOptions

`STWContentWithOptions` is similar to `STWContent`, it contains a list of
`option` elements (GUIDs). This type is useful for scenarios like menus and tabs
where the content is sourced from other elements.

```xml
<xs:complexType name="STWContentWithOptions">
    <xs:annotation>
        <xs:documentation>A content element that holds a list of references (options) to other STWElements, instead of nested child elements. Useful for menus and tabs where content is sourced from elsewhere.</xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>
    <xs:complexContent>
        <xs:extension base="STWElement">
            <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element name="options" minOccurs="0">
                    <xs:complexType>
                        <xs:sequence>
                            <xs:element name="option" type="GUID" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" />
                        </xs:sequence>
                    </xs:complexType>
                </xs:element>
                <xs:element name="layout" type="STWLayout" minOccurs="0" />
            </xs:sequence>
            <xs:attribute name="subtype" type="xs:string" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="override" type="xs:boolean" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="readonly" type="xs:boolean" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="cssClass" type="xs:string" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="section" type="xs:string" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="sequence" type="xs:integer" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="dsn" type="xs:string" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="query" type="xs:string" use="optional" />
            <xs:attribute name="params" type="xs:string" use="optional" />
        </xs:extension>
    </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
```

#### Property Description:

- **subtype**: Specifies the type of content to be rendered. Possible values
  include `Menu`, `Tabs`, and `Accordium`.

## The Webbase Placeholders Language (WBPL)

The Webbase Placeholders Language (WBPL) is a string processing language
designed for creating dynamic, data-driven queries. It works by taking a
template string and a map of placeholders, then producing a final string by
substituting placeholders and conditionally including or excluding parts of the
template based on whether the placeholders have values.

Here is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Placeholder Syntax**: WBPL identifies placeholders using an `@` symbol. The
   syntax supports different forms, such as `@`, `@@`, and `@@@`, which may have
   distinct meanings. Placeholders can be used directly (unquoted) or enclosed
   in single or double quotes.

2. **Substitution**:
   - **Simple Substitution**: For unquoted placeholders like `@name`, the engine
     directly replaces them with the corresponding value from the placeholders
     map.
   - **Quoted Substitution**: For quoted placeholders like `'@name'`, the engine
     replaces them with the value, automatically ensuring the value is correctly
     quoted and that any internal quotes are escaped. This is crucial for safely
     embedding string values in languages like SQL.
   - **List Expansion**: A special syntax exists for quoted placeholders
     followed by an ellipsis (`...`), such as `'@ids'...'`. This is designed to
     expand a comma-separated value into a properly quoted, comma-separated list
     (e.g., expanding a string `"1,2,3"` into `'1','2','3'`). This is
     particularly useful for generating SQL `IN` clauses.

3. **Conditional Blocks**: The language supports two types of conditional blocks
   that control whether a piece of text is included in the final output.
   - **Curly Braces `{...}`**: Text inside curly braces is included **only if**
     at least one placeholder within it is successfully replaced with a
     non-empty value. If all placeholders inside are empty or non-existent, the
     entire block (including the braces) is removed. This is useful for
     including optional text that depends on a value being present.
   - **Square Brackets `[...]`**: This block behaves similarly to curly braces,
     but with an added feature for cleaning up query syntax. If the block is
     removed because its placeholders are empty, the engine will also
     intelligently remove a single adjacent keyword (like `AND`, `OR`, `WHERE`).
     This is designed to handle optional conditional clauses in SQL. For
     example, in `SELECT * FROM users WHERE 1=1 [AND user_id = @id]`, the `AND`
     keyword and the entire bracketed expression will be removed if `@id` has no
     value.

4. **Escaping**:
   - The language respects escaped at-symbols (`\@`), treating them as literal
     `@` characters rather than the start of a placeholder.
   - It correctly handles and escapes quotes within values during substitution
     to prevent syntax errors or potential injection vulnerabilities.

In essence, WBPL is a security-conscious templating engine tailored for
generating dynamic queries and other text formats where parts of the content are
conditional.

## Webbase and Webbaselets

A complete WBDL document, representing a full portal, is called a **webbase**. A
key requirement for a valid webbase is that it must contain exactly one
`STWSite` element, which serves as the root of the entire structure.

However, it is also possible to create smaller, modular WBDL files called
**webbaselets**. A webbaselet is a WBDL document that does _not_ contain an
`STWSite` element. Instead, its root element must be an `STWArea`. Webbaselets
are designed to be portable fragments that can be imported or included within a
larger webbase.

This modularity ensures that the portal can evolve without requiring a
monolithic update, promoting agility and long-term maintainability.

## Future Directions: AI Agent Integration

Looking ahead, a significant evolution for the **Spin the Web Studio** is the
integration of AI agents. In this vision, the Studio would transform from a
manual editing tool into an intelligent development environment. An AI agent
could assist the full-stack professional by:

- **Automating WBDL Generation**: Generating complex WBDL structures from
  high-level natural language descriptions (e.g., "Create a customer dashboard
  with an order history table and a contact form").
- **Optimizing Queries**: Analyzing `STWContent` queries and suggesting more
  efficient alternatives or identifying potential performance bottlenecks.
- **Ensuring Best Practices**: Providing real-time feedback to ensure the
  webbase adheres to design principles, security standards, and performance
  guidelines.
- **Simplifying Data Integration**: Assisting in the configuration of
  datasources and the mapping of data to content elements, reducing manual
  effort.

This would represent a major leap forward, allowing developers to build and
maintain portals with greater speed and precision, making the Studio an even
more effective component of the Spin the Web ecosystem.

# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

### Positive Behaviors
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Sharing knowledge and helping others learn portal development concepts
- Providing constructive technical feedback on book content and examples
- Encouraging participation from people of all backgrounds and skill levels

### Unacceptable Behaviors
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Dismissing or attacking someone based on their level of technical experience
- Gatekeeping or elitist behavior that discourages participation
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Educational Environment

As this project focuses on technical education and enterprise portal development, we especially value:

- **Constructive Learning**: Questions at all levels are welcome and encouraged
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Experienced developers should mentor newcomers
- **Technical Accuracy**: Corrections and improvements to content should be made respectfully
- **Professional Discourse**: Maintain the same standards you would in a professional workplace
- **Inclusive Examples**: Ensure code examples and scenarios are inclusive and accessible

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at conduct@spintheweb.org.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### What to Include in Reports
- Your contact information
- Names (usernames, real names) of any individuals involved
- Your account of what occurred, including any relevant screenshots or links
- Any additional information that may be helpful

### What Happens After Reporting
- You will receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours
- The incident will be investigated confidentially
- Appropriate action will be taken based on our enforcement guidelines
- You will be informed of the outcome

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

This part focuses on practical implementation details, guiding you from conceptual models to running systems. It bridges the specification layer to concrete engineering choices across language, runtime, tooling, and deployment.

We cover the selected technology stack, module boundaries, build strategy, and the mechanics of transforming WBDL/WBPL inputs into production-grade web portals. Particular attention is given to developer experience, testability, observability, and security.

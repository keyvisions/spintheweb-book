With the Spin the Web framework fully specified in Part II, this part transitions from engineering blueprints to practical application. It serves as the developer's guide to the models and methodologies for *using* the framework to design, build, and structure a real-world enterprise portal.

This part covers the methodology for translating business requirements into a logical portal structure and explores the learning path and mindset required to become a proficient portal developer. Throughout, we reference the public website \href{https://spintheweb.org}{spintheweb.org} and the companion \textit{Spin the Web Studio}—both built with the framework—as running examples of the patterns described here. For an overview of the community catalog used to discover and rate webbaselets, see the Ecosystem webbaselet in \cref{sec:app-ecosystem}.

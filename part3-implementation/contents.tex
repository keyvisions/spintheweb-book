\begin{quote}
\textit{"Structure is the substrate of meaning; when well designed it becomes self-documenting and accelerates delivery."}
\end{quote}

This chapter covers how to model and implement the *informational side* of an enterprise portal using \wbdl{}: Areas, Pages, and Content blocks as semantic anchors; embedded documentation as a living knowledge system; and patterns for navigation, search, and task execution. The emphasis is on how structure transforms raw enterprise data into durable, navigable knowledge assets.

\section{From Organization to Information Architecture}
\label{sec:contents-org-to-ia}
The starting point for portal content modeling is the enterprise itself. Business functions, departments, service domains, and stakeholder-facing capabilities provide the *semantic inventory* that becomes your top-level \texttt{STWArea} set. Mapping is a translation exercise:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Collect the official organizational chart(s) and cross-functional process maps.
	\item Identify external-facing vs. internal-only domains; decide which are public, private, or hybrid.
	\item Normalize naming (short, role-recognizable labels) and prune redundancies.
	\item Annotate each candidate Area with primary audiences, core data domains, and governing policies.
	\item Prioritize rollout sequence (critical operations first, supporting domains next, exploratory later).
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Example Top-Level Areas} A manufacturing enterprise might define: Sales, Administration, Backoffice, Technical Office, Products \& Services. Each becomes an \texttt{STWArea} root for subordinate Pages and Content.

Area definitions embed *living documentation* through localized \texttt{name}, \texttt{description}, and \texttt{keywords}. This collapses the distance between operational knowledge and runtime structure: the portal itself becomes the manual.

\section{Hierarchical Semantics and Namespaces}
Hierarchy provides cognitive compression. The \emph{Hierarchical Namespace Pattern} organizes content so users predict where information lives. Recommended principles:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Depth over width only when each level adds semantic clarity.
	\item Keep sibling counts manageable (7\,$\pm$\,2 heuristic for primary navigation tiers).
	\item Use stable identifiers (slugs) for Areas/Pages to preserve deep links and audit trails.
	\item Reflect role segmentation (what differs by role) at the \texttt{STWContent} or conditional rendering layer rather than duplicating structural nodes.
\end{itemize}
Roles shape *visibility* and *interaction surfaces* but should not fork the structural namespace unnecessarily. This separation sustains maintainability and consistent analytics.

\section{Documentation Through Structure}
Every \wbdl{} element (Site, Area, Page, Content) hosts localized \texttt{description} and \texttt{keywords}. These fields form a vertically integrated documentation system that can encode: quality policies, compliance references, process identifiers, KPIs, audit obligations, data classification tags, and internal taxonomy terms. \autoref{tab:doc-scope} summarizes scope alignment.

\begin{description}
	\item[Site] Mission, global quality policy, enterprise standards.
	\item[Area] Departmental procedures, regulatory scope, operating KPIs.
	\item[Page] Process walkthroughs, workflow prerequisites, exception handling.
	\item[Content] Field-level rules, validation, data retention, privacy notes.
\end{description}

Embedding this metadata enables: contextual help, machine-assisted authoring, internal semantic search, automated compliance extraction, and AI augmentation (linking processes to data touchpoints).

		Area & Department / Domain & Procedures, regulatory scope, data domains, risk class & Which regulations apply to this domain? Who owns the process? \\
		Page & Process / Journey & Workflow steps, prerequisites, exception handling, SLA & What happens before/after this step? What are escalation paths? \\
		Content & Field / Action Unit & Validation rules, retention, privacy flags, policy codes & Can this value be exported? How long is data retained? \\

\section{Core Page Archetypes}
Across domains three archetypes dominate main content regions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Dashboards}: Multi-source summaries for situational awareness and prioritization. Favor glanceable KPIs, deltas, and exception surfacing.
	\item \textbf{Tabular / List Views}: Filterable, paginated, sometimes hierarchical or pivot-capable collections enabling search+select workflows.
	\item \textbf{Detail Views}: Focused inspection/editing surfaces for a single entity with contextual navigation (previous/next, related entities, timeline overlays).
\end{itemize}
Composite pages combine archetypes (e.g., miniature dashboard widgets above a list). Resist uncontrolled aggregation—each archetype should answer a distinct question.

\section{User Journeys and Page Design}
Pages (\texttt{STWPage}) embody discrete user tasks or journeys. Design methodology:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Task Enumeration}: Elicit core user goals per Area (create quote, approve order, analyze defect rate).
	\item \textbf{Journey Mapping}: Sequence states and data intersections; identify required contextual jumps (entity cross-links) to minimize session fragmentation.
	\item \textbf{Structural Allocation}: Assign each journey to a Page; merge only if cognitive load stays low and authorization scopes match.
	\item \textbf{Section Layout}: Header (global actions), sidebars (navigation, filters, summaries), main body (primary archetype), footer (feedback, contacts).
	\item \textbf{Instrumentation}: Embed identifiers and metadata for analytics, ticketing, and performance tracing.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Integrated Ticketing} A mature portal treats structure itself as a support surface. Ticket submissions should auto-capture structural scope (site/area/page/content IDs), user locale, and active filters. This converts qualitative feedback into structured, triage-ready data.

\section{Building with Content Blocks}
\texttt{STWContent} instances are atomic functional or informational units: forms, tables, charts, grids, banners, maps, metrics, documents. Composition principles:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Single Responsibility}: Each block answers one primary question or supports one action cluster.
	\item \textbf{Declarative Data Binding}: Use \wbpl{} for parameterized queries; keep transformation logic close to data retrieval for transparency.
	\item \textbf{Progressive Disclosure}: Lazy-load heavy or low-priority content blocks to reduce initial cognitive and performance load.
	\item \textbf{Embedded Governance}: Include validation rules, policy codes, and retention hints inside \texttt{description} metadata.
	\item \textbf{Reusability}: Parameterize commonly repeated patterns (e.g., entity summary panels) rather than cloning definitions.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Example Composition} A public "Products" page may combine: hero banner (static), category menu (dynamic list), product grid (dynamic, filtered), featured carousel (dynamic curated), and call-to-action block—each a discrete \texttt{STWContent}.

\section{Search, Discovery, and Internal SEO}
Localized \texttt{keywords} and \texttt{description} fields drive internal search relevance. Two complementary modes:
\begin{description}
	\item[Global Search] Traverses full structural graph; returns heterogenous results ranked by metadata quality, usage signals, and recency.
	\item[In-Context Search] Operates within the active Page scope: filters list/table rows, quick-finds form fields, queries localized help.
\end{description}
Design guidance: persistent global search affordance (often header); proximal in-context search control near target content. Provide keyboard shortcuts, accessible labeling, and query history. Treat internal search analytics as a requirements radar (unmet search intent indicates structural or content gaps).

\section{Patterns and Evolution}
Long-term iteration reveals recurring cycles: pattern recognition $\rightarrow$ insight $\rightarrow$ abstraction $\rightarrow$ simplification. Content modeling matures by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consolidating duplicated structures into parameterized definitions.
	\item Elevating cross-cutting concerns (authorization tags, retention policies) into shared vocabularies.
	\item Refactoring deep hierarchies when navigation analytics show friction.
	\item Capturing emergent naming conventions to stabilize taxonomy.
	\item Instrumenting evolution (version history of structural nodes) to support audits and AI summarization.
\end{itemize}
The endpoint is elegant simplicity: a minimal, expressive structure that scales without combinatorial explosion.

\section{Conclusion}
The content layer transforms disparate enterprise data into structured, navigable, contextual information assets. By treating every node (Area/Page/Content) as both functional unit and documentation carrier, the portal becomes a continuously evolving, queryable knowledge base that supports operations, compliance, and learning.
